Geography File:
Located At http://www2.census.gov/acs2009_5yr/summaryfile/2005-2009_ACSSF_By_State_All_Tables/*.zip
Year = [xxxx] - Last year of the period
Period = [x] - Period length in years
State = [AB] - Standard state abreviation
Filename = "g" + Year + Period + State + ".txt"

File Columns:
NAME		DESCRIPTION 				SIZE 	START
---------------------------------------------------------
FILEID	 	"ACSSF"						6		1
STUSAB 		State Postal Abbreviation 	2 		7 
SUMLEVEL 	Summary Level 				3 		9 
COMPONENT 	Geographic Component 		2 		12
LOGRECNO 	Logical Record Number 		7 		14

Many other columns too numerous to enumerate here, but documented in http://www2.census.gov/acs2009_5yr/summaryfile/ACS_2005-2009_SF_Tech_Doc.pdf section 2.4
Other columns include State, County, Tract, and Block Group, which can be used to map geographic areas to a Logical Record Number




Shape File:
Located at http://www.census.gov/geo/cob/bdy/bg/bg00shp/bg[FIPS-code]_d00_shp.zip 
[FIPS-code] is a somewhat arbitrary 2-digit code corresponding to a US state, see link in Resources section.
Index of files: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bg2000.html
Relevant Metadata for each polygon:
 - STATE - FIPS 5-2 state code
 - COUNTY - 3-digit county code
 - TRACT - 6-digit census tract code
 - BLKGROUP - 1 digit block group code
 
NOTE: While the shapefile TRACT field does map directly

Maps Column Names to Sequence Numbers and Row Locations
Each row corresponds to a column in one of the Estimate/MoE files, except some which are aggregates.
File Columns:
 - File ID (fileid) - Always "ACSSF" as far as I can tell
 - Table ID (tblid) - Useless for our purposes
 - Sequence Numbers (seq) - Correspond to names of Estimate/MoE files
 - Line Number (col) - Misnomer, this is really column number (sort of).  The actual column number is 
	 computed as (position + col - 1), with the first column as 1.  Individual lines within a Estimate/MoE 
	 file correspond to different locations by LOGRECNO
 - Position (position) - The starting position to compute the real column number as described above.  
	 If position is undefined for the current row, it inherits from the one above it.
 - Cells (cells1) - Total number of columns for aggregate column types.  Redundant and useless.
 - Total cells in sequence (cells2) - Total number of cells for a sequence (only appears in one row for 
	 a given sequence number).  Redundant and useless.
 - Title (title) - Column Description
 
In addition to the columns, there are several "types" of rows.  There are normal ones, which have 
(fileid, tblid, seq, col, title) fields but are missing (position, cells1, cells2).  These correspond to actual
numbers in actual files and are basically what we want.  They are unfortunately missing essential information in 
the title which is provided by header rows.  

There are two types of header rows, Measurement and Demographic. Measurement headers are the only rows with position 
defined and always have cells1 defined as well. If it is the last measurement header for a sequence number, it will also 
have cells2 defined. Their title fields are in all caps and describe the type of measurement for all their children, 
sometimes followed by demographic in () (e.g. "SEX BY AGE". Demographic headers always (?) immediately follow 
Measurement headers (if the are present at all; unknown if they can be absent). They don't have entries for (col, 
position, cells1, cells2), and their titles always start with "Universe: " followed by a description of the demographic 
(e.g. "Universe: People reporting single ancestry"). Thus, to get the full information about what a row really means, 
you need the row's title as well as the titles for its Measurement and Demographic headers. 

EDIT: We have since discovered that the titles for this file are essentially a tree, with headers as nodes and the actual titles as leaves.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to extract this tree structure, as there is no indication of parent-child relationship, and the only indication of node depth is encoded in the formatting of the cell, which we cannot easily extract.

Maps Column Names to Table IDs
Structure is the same as Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls but has slightly different columns
File Columns:
 - Table ID (tblid) - Same as Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls tblid
 - Line (col) - Same as Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls col
 - Unique ID (id) - Equal to tblid + (3 digit int)(col).  Maps directly to the ids in the first row of the 2005-2009_SummaryFileXLS files, except the ids in those files are equal to tblid + '_' + (3 digit int)(col)
 - Stub (title) - Same as Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls title

This file is useful for mapping desired column names to ids (the Unique ID column).  The location for each unique id is extracted from the 2005-2009_SummaryFileXLS files.  Unfortunately, it shares the same naming deficiencies that Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls does, so this must be done manually, at least for the moment.


2005-2009_SummaryFileXLS files
These files are named Seq[seq].xls, where [seq] is the sequence number the file corresponds to (they vary from "Seq1.xls" to "Seq117.xls").  Each file contains the schema for the corresponding Estimate and MoE files.  Each contains only two rows, the first is the ID of the corresponding column in the Estimate MoE files.  The first 6 column names are always FILEID	FILETYPE	STUSAB	CHARITER	SEQUENCE	LOGRECNO.  The remainder are unique ids (e.g. B08406_002) corresponding to the unique ids found in ACS2009_5-Year_TableShells.xls.
The second row is the column names, however, while some of them are fairly descriptive (e.g. "Workers 16 years and over"), others are entirely useless (e.g. "MEAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF QUINTILES, Universe: Households, Quintile Means:, Lowest Quintile" in ACS2009_5-Year_TableShells.xls becomes "Households% Households" in its corresponding sequence file).  The second row should therefore be ignored completely.
These files are useful for mapping unique ids to sequence numbers and column numbers.


Estimate and MoE Files: 
Located at http://www2.census.gov/acs2009_5yr/summaryfile/2005-2009_ACSSF_By_State_All_Tables/*.zip
Naming convention is as follows (x denotes a digit):
Type = ["e" | "m"] - Estimate or Margin of error
Year = [xxxx] - Last year of the period
Period = [x] - Period length in years
State = [AB] - Standard state abreviation
Seq = [xxxx] - Sequence Number
Res = [xxx] - Reserved for future use, currently "000"
Filename = Type + Year + Period + State + Seq + Res + ".txt"

Each file contains a bunch of rows from a database with the following schema:
FIELD NAME 			DESCRIPTION 					FIELD SIZE		NOTES	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEID 				File Identification				6 Characters	Always "ACSSF"
FILETYPE 			File Type 						6 Characters	Year + Type + Period
STUSAB 				State/U.S.-Abbreviation (USPS) 	2 Characters	State
CHARACTER 			Character Iteration 			3 Characters	Seems to correspond to Res (i.e. currently always "000")
SEQUENCE 			Sequence Number 				4 Characters	Seq
LOGRECNO 			Logical Record Number 			7 Characters	Location Identifier
Field # 7 and up 	Estimates 						Various			Defined by position and cells in Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_Lookup.xls

256 is a hard max for number of fields in one row.
